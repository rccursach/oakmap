A pilot program of Kiva in 2011. Direct loan model. Internationally they work with microfinance partners abroad, but at home they've launched a direct model. Lending directly from people to people, with a partnership with PayPal, who don't charge any processing fees. Internationally there are fees with other partners. Bring lenders closer to borrowers. First strategy to grow the program was tech and ad based to grow the program via online channels. But what they found was that applicants that came from these channels weren't the most prepared, so they changed the strategy to be community-focused growth and invest in P2P relationships and building stronger relationships with other service providers and community orgs. Process works by: somebody finds out about Kiva, and then work with someone like Elanna on the application or another Kiva employee in one of their ten Kiva cities.
