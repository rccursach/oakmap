Instead of bank loans, members can create and issue the appropriate amount of Bay Bucks to meet their business expenses. Instead of letting their unsold products sit idly in warehouses or allowing their un-billed services to expire worthless, Bay Bucks helps members trade things they have in excess for things they need - turning their unsold items into assets.  Local businesses bartering helps everyone save cash, increase profit margins, share resources and reduce waste - all while building a stronger local economy.\n\nWhy complementary currency?\nBuying local is great - it helps keep more cash in the community than shopping at chain stores.  However, about 30% of dollars still leak out of the local community, draining wealth away from Bay Area residents and businesses.
